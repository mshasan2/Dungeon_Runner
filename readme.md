## How to Use the Program

### How to use the Graphical User Interface version of the Dungeon Game

1. As soon as you type in the command to run the GUI version of the Game, a new Frame will open, this frame contains a Dungeon Map on the left side and the details screen on the right side.

2. To navigate the player through the Dungeon, the user can either make use of the arrow keys in the KeyBoard or can click on the arrow button on the Right Side Panel.

3. When the Player lands in a Cave with Treasure, the treasure can be picked up by pressing the T key on the KeyBoard.

4. When the player lands in a Location with arrows, the arrows can be picked up by pressing the A key on the KeyBoard.

5. Player can shoot an Otyuh by pressing on the S key on the keyBoard.
6. When a cave contains Treasure, the treasure icon is displayed in the Dungeon Map.

7. When a Location contains Arrows, the arrow icon is displayed in the Dungeon Map.

8. When the user is in the vincinity of a Otyugh, the smell eminating from the Otyugh is displayed as an icon in the Dungeon Map.

9. If the user wins the Game after killing the Otyugh in the Goal cave and navigates to the Goal Cave, then Player won message is displayed.
10. When the user enters into a cave inhabited by the Otyugh and the player dies, Game over message is displayed.

11. After Player picks up treasure, the player description is updated and this can be seen in the side panel of the game under the heading Player Description.

13. The the methods to display the view are present in the DungeonViewImpl class.

14. The methods for the GUI controller are present in the DungeonGUIController class.

15. To add a click listener to the view we can make use of the addClickListener method of the DungeonViewImpl class.

16. To add a keyBoard listener to the view we can make use of the addKeyListener method of the DungeonViewImpl class.

17. To handle a cell click we can make use of the handleCellClick method of the Controller

18. To handle a keyboard button press we can make use of the handleKeyPressed method of the Controller.

### How to use the Text Based Version of the Dungeon Game

1. As soon as you type the above command to run the java application with valid command line arguments, the java application will run and will print out the details of the Dungeon game.

2. If Invalid input values are passed to the program, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

3. A user can select whether the Dungeon is generated randomly or if the same dungeon is returned by passing the appropriate parameter in the Constructor of the DungeonImpl class.

4. Create Model of the Dungeon game, the type of the model should be DungeonModel, we pass the parameters of the game like Dungeon Row Size (Integer Value), Dungeon Column Size (Integer Value), Interconnectivity of Dungeon (Integer Value), Is Dungeon Wrapping (Boolean Value), Percent Of Treasures in Caves (Integer Value), Number Of Monsters in the Dungeon (Integer Value).

5. Create a Controller of the Dungeon game, the controller takes in the desired input type and the desired output type as the parameters.

6. We begin the game by passing in the model created in step 4 as a parameter to the playGame() method of Controller.

7. The user inputs are requested which are used to progress the game.

8. If the string representation of the dungeon is desired we can make use of the below methods of the DungeonModel interface getDungeonRepresentation(), getDungeonRepresentationWithCavesAndTunnel(), getDungeonRepresentationWithTreasures(), getDungeonRepresentationWithOtyugh() and etDungeonRepresentationWithArrows() methods return the String representation of the Dungeon.

## Design/Model Changes

 1. I have retained most of my code from Project 3 and Project 4 and have added new functionality for the view in Project 5.
 2. In Project 5 initial design, I added classes and interfaces to represent the view and the controller for the GUI, in the revised version of my UML design I have additional package private classes(DungeonMap and DungeonSidePanel classes) to the View, this helped me break down the code and makes sure that one class is responsible for one kind of task.
 3. I have added additional methods for the controller and the model and have made some public classes to private classes.

## Assumptions

1. The first assumption I have made is that Percentage of Treasure in a cave cannot be greater than 100 percent.
2. Player can collect all the treasures/arrows he/she wants, Player has unlimited treasure/arrow carrying capacity.
3. As the player cannot know the actual number of caves at the start of the game, so when the player enters a large number of Otyughs, and if the number is greater than the actual number of caves, we add the maximum possible number of Otyughs in the game. We don’t display an Error because as the dungeon is generated randomly, the actual number of caves cannot be guessed, hence there is a huge that the player will not be able to guess the maximum number of Otyughs permissible.
4. However long a game may go, Otyugh don’t starve and die, they have a lot of patience and hunger capacity.
5. If a user decides to pick treasures/arrows, then all the treasures/arrows present in a Location will be picked.
6. Player Description is displayed always as I have assumed that Player always requires the Player Description
7. User collects all the treasures  present in a Cave when they press the T button
8. User collects all the Arrows present in a Location when they press the A button.
9. As user is always asked to play in a Random Dungeon, we do not ask the user in the New Game option in the Menu, if they want to play a non random game as we are assuming that Player always wants to play random game.


## Limitations

1. User is not given an option to enter the maximum number of moves he can make before the game terminates.
2. The Dungeon hasn't been tested for very large dungeons like the dungeons of size 100 * 100.
3. In my current implementation the Player collects all the treasures present in the cave, regardless of the number of treasures he has collected before.
4. When user is asked whether to pickup treasure or arrow, and user enters an invalid input, the invalid input is not considered and no prompt is shown that the input is invalid.
